Your task is to analyze the user's request and create a comprehensive natural language outline for how to model it parametrically.

Best Practices:
{bestPractices}

User Request: {userRequest}

Please analyze this request and provide a detailed natural language outline that describes:
1. The main parts/components of the model
2. The sequence of operations needed for each part
3. How the parts connect or interact with each other
4. Any specific geometric relationships or constraints

Your response should be in clear, step-by-step natural language that another system can use to generate the actual Grasshopper components.
Focus on describing the what and why, not the specific component names or parameters.

Example format:
""To create a coffee mug, we need to model two main parts: the mug body and the handle.

For the mug body:
1. Start with a base circle that will form the bottom of the mug
2. Create a surface from this circle
3. Extrude the circle vertically to create the mug's side walls
4. Join the base surface with the extruded walls
5. Offset the joined surfaces to create thickness

For the handle:
1. Create a curve defined by several control points
2. Create a circle at one end of the curve
3. Move the circle along the curve to create the handle's path
4. Create a surface from the moved circle
5. Boolean union the handle with the mug body""

Remember:
1. Focus on describing the geometric operations and relationships
2. Break down complex operations into clear, sequential steps
3. Explain how different parts of the model connect or interact
4. Include any important geometric constraints or relationships
5. If the request is too complex, respond with {{TOO_COMPLEX}}";
